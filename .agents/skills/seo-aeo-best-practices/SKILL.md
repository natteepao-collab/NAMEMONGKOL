# SEO & AEO Best Practices

Principles for optimizing content for both traditional search engines (SEO) and AI-powered answer engines (AEO). Includes Google's EEAT guidelines and structured data implementation.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Implementing metadata and Open Graph tags
- Creating sitemaps and robots.txt
- Adding JSON-LD structured data
- Optimizing content for featured snippets
- Preparing content for AI assistants (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.)
- Evaluating content quality using EEAT principles

## Core Concepts

### SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
Optimizing content to rank well in traditional search results (Google, Bing).

### AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)
Optimizing content to be selected as authoritative answers by AI systems.

### EEAT (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)
Google's framework for evaluating content quality.

## Project Context: NameMongkol

### EEAT Strategy
- **Expertise/Authority**: Position NameMongkol as the "Scientific" expert. Explain "Why" and "How" behind numerology, not just results.
- **Trustworthiness**: Cite sources (Thaksa scriptures), show transparent analysis methods, and include user reviews/case studies (as per SEO Plan Week 1 & 2).

### AEO/GEO Focus
- **Tone**: Professional, Trustworthy, Empowering, Mystical yet Scientific.
- **Answer Formats**: Use clear definitions, lists, and direct answers for questions like "What is..." or "How to...".
- **Structured Data**: Implement `HowTo` for naming guides, `FAQPage` for Q&A, and `SoftwareApplication` for the analysis tool.
